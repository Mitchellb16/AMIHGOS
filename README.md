# About
AMIHGOS (Automated Marmoset Imaging Helmet Generator - Open Source) Is a tool developed in Python for extracting head topology from CT images to generate custom 3D printable helmets to non-invasively reduce movement noise in neuroimaging. 

This tool was developed by adapting code from the [SimpleITK tutorial notebooks](https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/), David T. Chen's [dicom2stl](https://github.com/dave3d/dicom2stl/tree/main) script, and examples from the [Pyvista project](https://pyvista.org/).
Modifications to these tools were made to optimize functionality with the model organism and to establish compatibility with the [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) GUI development libraries.

ChatGPT 3.5 was also used to develop the GUI portions of this program.
